**Variables** are containers that hold data values. They are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.

In short, a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable. 

Each variable has a unique **name** and a **value** that can be of different types. C++ has various built-in data types that define the type of value a variable can hold.

To initialize a variable, we use the following **format**:

```cpp
variable_type variable_name = value;
```

When declaring variables in C++, you need to specify the type of the variable before the variable name. This is known as **type declaration**. Once a variable is declared with a certain type, it can only hold values of that type.
